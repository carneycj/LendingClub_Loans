# LendingClub_Loans
A data science project in which LendingClub loan data is taken, cleaned, and visualized. Then, a machine learning model is developed to determine who would fail to pay the loan back in full.  The data itself is originally from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club

It was then edited by Jose Marcial Portilla (Pierian Data Inc.) to add more feature engineering opportunities as part of the capstone project.
